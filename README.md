#  Codility Challenges Solutions

Welcome to my **Codility Challenges** repository!  
This repo documents my approach to solving various Codility exercises and algorithmic problems.

##  About
Each challenge folder or file in this repository walks you through **my full thinking process** — from the initial logic and failed attempts, to the **final optimized solution**.  
The goal is not only to solve the problems but also to **document the learning journey** and show how I improved each solution step by step.

##  Structure
Every challenge includes:
-  **Problem description** (what the exercise is about)  
-  **First attempts** (commented-out code showing the initial logic and why it didn’t work)  
-  **Refinements** (adjustments made along the way)  
-  **Final solution** (optimized and clean implementation)

##  Example
**Challenge:** Find the element in an array that doesn’t have a pair.

- First, I tried using a simple for-loop to remove like terms — but it had incrementing bugs.
- Then, I switched to a `while` loop for more control — still not perfect.
- Finally, I implemented a clean and efficient method using sorting and a `for` loop with step `i += 2` to identify the unpaired element efficiently.

##  Repository Goal
This repository serves as a **personal documentation of problem-solving growth** and a reference for others learning to write clean, efficient JavaScript solutions.
